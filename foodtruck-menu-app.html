    <h1>FoodTruck Menu App</h1>
    <p class="description">Food Truck Menu App allows to search for food trucks in the area, view their menu, as well as
      obtain information about the calorific value of meals, nutrients and allergens. It also allows you to order meals
      without queuing.</p>

    <h2 class="project-header">The goal</h2>
    <p class="description">Design an app which allows find food truck with the rich menu close to user..</p>

    <h2 class="project-header">Target audience</h2>
    <p class="description">People who want to keep fit and take care of nutrients in their meals. Additionally allergy
      suffers could use it to check if dish contains any allergens.</p>

    <h2 class="project-header">Key challanges</h2>
    <p class="description">The key was to create views that accurately describe the menu content with pictures of dishes
      and ingredients, as well as a complete set of information about nutrients, allergens and calories.</p>

    <h2 class="project-header">Research study</h2>
    <p class="description">People complain about the lack of enough information on the menu and the problem with finding
      a food truck. They want to have all the information in one place so that they do not get distracted when ordering
      a meal.</p>

    <h2 class="project-header">Initial design concepts</h2>
    <p class="description">When designing the homepage, I wanted the user to be able to easily search for a food truck
      and to have access to recommended restaurants in his area..</p>
    <div class="images-container row">
      <div class="image-wrapper row">
        <img class="project-image" src="/images/foodtruck-menu-initial-design.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="project-header">Wireframes</h2>
    <p class="description">Moving from paper to digital
      wireframes made it easy to understand how the redesign could help address user pain points and improve the user
      experience. To achieve these goals I added a left filter card which allows filter results and added a place for a
      rich course description.</p>
    <div class="images-container row">
      <div class="image-wrapper ">
        <img class="project-image " src="/images/foodtruck-menu-wireframes.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="project-header">User testing results</h2>
    <p class="description">User feedback after testing shows that there are several things that can be changed. The
      'Search' button on the home page was confusing. The user expects to enter something and not redirect to the map
      view. Information about nutrients, weight, calories and allergens take too much place.</p>
    <div class="images-container row">
      <div class="image-wrapper ">
        <img class="project-image " src="/images/foodtruck-menu-before-after-usability-study.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="project-header">Mockups</h2>
    <p class="description">I took into account the
      concerns of users and
      changed the name of the
      button that redirects to the
      map view. Instead of showing all the
      information that would
      need to be scrolled, I used
      the expansion panel.
      Thanks to this, the user can
      choose the most important
      information without
      unnecessary scrolling
      through the content. You can see final result below.</p>
    <div class="images-container row">
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img class="project-image" src="/images/foodtruck-menu-mockup-1.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img class="project-image" src="/images/foodtruck-menu-mockup-2.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="project-header">What I learned</h2>
    <p class="description">I learned that it's worth being mindful of your prejudices. What is obvious to me as a
      designer on a site can be difficult for a user to change. Additionally, I learned how to design lo-fi and hi-fi
      prototypes in the Figma environment.</p>

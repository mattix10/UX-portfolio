    <h1>Dancefloor Courses Website</h1>
    <p class=" description">DANCEfloor is a website where you can buy a special dance courses to learn dance online
      dedicated to people who
      have no time to go to typical dance school or this kind of school is so far from them. DANCEfloor goal is connect
      best dance instructors with everyone</p>

    <h2 class="project-header">The goal</h2>
    <p class="description">Design Dance courses website where the user will be able to find right course and measure
      progress in learning by uploading video.</p>

    <h2 class="project-header">Target audience</h2>
    <p class="description">People who are interested in dance and would like to learn dance but from different reasons
      they can’t go to standard course and choose online version.</p>

    <h2 class="project-header">Key challanges</h2>
    <p class="description">Creating a design that will encourage the user to buy the course and give him all the
      necessary information to fully familiarize himself with the advantages of the course.</p>

    <h2 class="project-header">Research study</h2>
    <p class="description">I discovered that some people would like to learn dance but they have no time or the dance
      school is quite far away. In the Internet you can find many dance tutorials but they are in many places and it’s
      hard to verify their quality and find the right one. Additionally, participating in these courses the user can’t
      measure the progress.</p>

    <h2 class="project-header">Initial design concepts</h2>
    <p class="description">Preparing initial design concepts I took into account collecting all courses in one place
      and
      highlight recommended and most popular courses to suggest a choice for the user.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="project-header">Wireframes</h2>
    <p class="description">Moving from paper to digital
      wireframes made it easy to understand how the redesign could help address user pain points and improve the user
      experience. To achieve these goals I added a left filter card which allows filter results and added a place for
      a
      rich course description.</p>
    <div class="images-container row">
      <div class="image-wrapper">

      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img class="project-image" src="/images/dancefloor-wireframes-2.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="project-header">User testing results</h2>
    <p class="description">Users want to go to
      course after finalizing transaction. Based on the insights from the usability study, I added purple button which
      redirect user to
      purchased course.
    </p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="project-header">Mockups</h2>
    <p class="description">After creating digital wireframes and testing them, I made mockups and prototype.</p>
    <div class="images-container">
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img class="project-image" src="/images/dancefloor-mockups-1.jpg">

      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img class="project-image" src="/images/dancefloor-mockups-2.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="project-header">What I learned</h2>
    <p class="description">I learned that interfaces should be simple for the user, clearly navigate the user to take
      action, and shouldn't contain too much information that can overwhelm the user.</p>

      <h1>MedicineReminder App</h1>
      <p class="description">Medicine Reminder App is an application that reminds you to take your medication at the
        right
        time. The app thus helps to stay healthy and is especially useful for the elderly.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="project-header">The goal</h2>
      <p class="description">Design an app wichich allows to control the time you take medication and thus improve your
        health.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="project-header">Target audience</h2>
      <p class="description">The application is dedicated to people who constantly take medications or use dietary
        supplements and do not want to skip doses.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="project-header">Key challanges</h2>
      <p class="description">One of the most important things was to create a simple 'user flow' for adding medications
        and a clear reminder. As a result, the user is not overwhelmed by the multitude of options, but can quickly
        create
        his own drug list and receive notifications when the time comes to take the drug.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="project-header">Research study</h2>
      <p class="description">People wants to see not only an image of medicine but name, dose and hour too - it was a
        key
        insight which allowed adjust notification view to user requiremenets.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="project-header">Initial design concepts</h2>
      <p class="description">Before creating digital wireframes I started from sketching some draws on paper. I wondered
        how to simplify the process of adding drugs to list and show them in the separated list, so I sketched 6
        variations of this view and choose the best option.</p>
      <div class="images-container row">
        <div class="image-wrapper row">
          <img class="project-image" src="/images/medicine-reminder-initial-design.jpg">
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="project-header">Wireframes</h2>
      <p class="description">After drawing the views on a piece of paper, the time has come to transfer them to the
        digital world. To do this, I used the Figma program, in which I created the views below.</p>
      <div class="images-container row">
        <div class="image-wrapper ">
          <img class="project-image " src="/images/medicine-reminder-wireframes.jpg">
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="project-header">User testing results</h2>
      <p class="description">Users want to have additional information in ‘My drugs’ view. They want to know date of
        taking drugs so I added ‘Schedule’ header with date and hour of taking drugs. Additionally they want to see a
        name
        of drug, dose and an hour so I applied design changes.</p>
      <div class="images-container row">
        <div class="image-wrapper">
          <img class="project-image" src="/images/medicine-reminder-before-after-usability-study.jpg">
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="project-header">Mockups and prototypes</h2>
      <p class="description">The next step was preparing final mockup. After many experminets with colors, I decided to
        use navy blue color as accent, white color for cards, elements and light blue for backgorund.</p>
      <div class="images-container row">
        <div class="image-wrapper">
          <img class="project-image" src="/images/medicine-reminder-mockup-1.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="image-wrapper">
          <img class="project-image" src="/images/medicine-reminder-mockup-2.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="image-wrapper">
          <img class="project-image" src="/images/medicine-reminder-mockup-3.jpg">
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="project-header">What I learned</h2>
      <p class="description">I learned that it's worth being mindful of your prejudices. What is obvious to me as a
        designer on a site can be difficult for a user to change. Additionally, I learned how to design lo-fi and hi-fi
        prototypes in the Figma environment.</p>
